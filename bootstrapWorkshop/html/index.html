                        providing 180 kilojoules (43 kilocalories) of food energy, raw beetroot is a rich source (27% of
                        the Daily Value - DV) of folate and a moderate source (16% DV) of manganese, with other nutrients
                        having insignificant content (table).[18] The chemical adipic acid rarely occurs in nature, but occurs
                        naturally in beetroot. In preliminary research, beetroot juice reduced blood pressure in hypertensive

                        Fresh or dry spaghetti is cooked in a large pot of salted, boiling water and then drained in a colander (Italian: scolapasta).
                        In Italy, spaghetti is generally cooked al dente (Italian for "to the tooth"), fully cooked but still
                        firm to the bite. It may also be cooked to a softer consistency. Spaghettoni is a thicker spaghetti
                        which takes more time to cook. Spaghettini is a thinner form which takes less time to cook. Capellini
                        is a very thin form of spaghetti (it is also called "angel hair spaghetti" or "angel hair pasta")
                        which cooks very quickly. Utensils used in spaghetti preparation include the spaghetti scoop and
                        spaghetti tongs.

            <h1>Wild & Wacky Vegetables</h1>
            <p>
                Vegetables play an important role in human nutrition. Most are low in fat and calories but are bulky and filling.[18] They
                supply dietary fiber and are important sources of essential vitamins, minerals, and trace elements. Particularly
                important are the antioxidant vitamins A, C, and E. When vegetables are included in the diet, there is found
                to be a reduction in the incidence of cancer, stroke, cardiovascular disease, and other chronic ailments.[19][20][21]
                Research has shown that, compared with individuals who eat less than three servings of fruits and vegetables
                each day, those that eat more than five servings have an approximately twenty percent lower risk of developing
                coronary heart disease or stroke.[22] The nutritional content of vegetables varies considerably; some contain
                useful amounts of protein though generally they contain little fat,[23] and varying proportions of vitamins
                such as vitamin A, vitamin K, and vitamin B6; provitamins; dietary minerals; and carbohydrates.

                providing 180 kilojoules (43 kilocalories) of food energy, raw beetroot is a rich source (27% of the Daily
                Value - DV) of folate and a moderate source (16% DV) of manganese, with other nutrients having insignificant

            <p>Carrots are grown from seed and can take up to four months (120 days) to mature, but most cultivars mature within
                70 to 80 days under the right conditions.[35] They grow best in full sun but tolerate some shade.[36] The
                optimum temperature is 16 to 21 °C (61 to 70 °F).[37] The ideal soil is deep, loose and well-drained, sandy
                or loamy, with a pH of 6.3 to 6.8.[38] Fertilizer should be applied according to soil type because the crop
                requires low levels of nitrogen, moderate phosphate and high potash. Rich or rocky soils should be avoided,
                as these will cause the roots to become hairy and/or misshapen.[39] Irrigation is applied when needed to
                keep the soil moist. After sprouting, the crop is eventually thinned to a spacing of 8 to 10 cm (3 to 4 in)
                and weeded to prevent competition beneath the soil.[35][40]</p>
